      <description>Bio-fluid mechanics I am teaching a course on Bio-fluid mechanics as part of the lecture &amp;ldquo;Data-integrated Simulation Science A&amp;rdquo;, Master program Simulation Technology, at the University of Stuttgart where I am a guest lecturer (W21/22, W22/23, WS23/24).
The course integrates physiological background, mathematical modelling, numerical theory, and practical implementation of ideas in Python.
Link to lecture notes (work in progress and are continuously updated and expanded)
A Python script plotting velocity profiles for pulsating flow in a circular tube for different Womersley numbers can be found here.</description>

      <description>DuMux &amp;mdash; DUNE for Multi-{Phase, Component, Scale, Physics, …} flow and transport in porous media DuMux is a simulation framework with a focus on finite volume discretization methods, model coupling for multi-physics applications, and flow and transport applications in porous media.
I am one of the main developers of the open-source simulator DuMux.
Visit the DuMux website or the official DuMux GitLab repository to learn more.
Recent ideas and concepts behind DuMux are described in our recent publication: T.</description>

      <description>2024 23 Dec 24 Our preprint __Estimation of fluid flow velocities in cortical brain tissue driven by the microvasculature __ is available on bioRxiv (with Kent-André Mardal). Fluid transport through brain tissue is dynamic, but the basic properties of this flow and its variability are poorly characterised. Disturbed fluid transport was linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, fluid flow may be exploited to administer drugs to the brain. Using computer simulations, we estimate bulk flow velocities in the gray matter functional brain tissue due to changes in blood pressure and solute concentrations in unseen detail.</description>

      <description>Research topics Research topics Embedded networks Numerics of multi-physics PDE problems Transport in brain tissue Transport in plants Reduced models for porous media Microfluidics / tissue engineering Research software engineering Embedded networks One of my ongoing research topics concerns the development of mixed-dimensional models for flow and transport processes in porous media with embedded network systems.
Many natural and technical porous media contain network structures to facilitate transport into and from these materials that usually have a low permeability.</description>
